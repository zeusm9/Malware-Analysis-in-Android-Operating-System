Malware Analysis in Android Operating System using machine learning techniques
The first goal of the project is: given all the applications in the dataset,
create a binary classifier that can detect if an application is a malware or a
non-malware. Morever the malwares need to be classified correctly with the
family they belong to.
For doing this it has been used two different approaches and two different
kind of classifiers. First of all it has been used the Naive Bayes classier
using the Multinomial distribution, it has been evaluated the performances
and then they have been compared with the performances obtained with the
support vector machines (SVM).
The naive Bayes classiffiers are based on the Bayes' theorem. Bayes' The-
orem nds the probability of an event occurring given the probability of
another event that has already occurred. The naive Bayes approach is good
in many use cases like text classification, email spam detection, face recogni-
tion, weather predictions and so on.
Like naive Bayes, the support vector machines are supervised learning mod-
els. A support vector machine constructs a hyperplane or a set of hyperplanes
which can be used for classification.
